## AgroMini: An Agricultural Simulation Engine in Rust

### Overview
AgroMini is a high-performance agricultural simulation engine written in Rust. It allows users to simulate various agricultural processes, including planting, seed loading, crop growth, and the impact of weather conditions on agriculture. AgroMini aims to provide a flexible, efficient, and scalable framework for modeling agricultural scenarios and analyzing outcomes.

### Features
#### Planting Simulation:

Simulate the process of planting various crops, taking into account factors such as seed type, planting depth, and soil conditions.
Support for diverse crop types, each with unique growth characteristics and requirements.

#### Seed Loading:

Load and manage different seed types, including setting initial conditions like seed quality, quantity, and germination rates.
Customize seed attributes to reflect different species or genetic variations.

#### Crop Growth and Development:

Model crop growth stages, from germination to harvest, influenced by soil quality, temperature, moisture, and other environmental factors.
Dynamic adjustment of growth rates based on real-time simulation of environmental conditions.

#### Weather Simulation:

Simulate weather patterns, including temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and wind, to observe their effects on crop development.
Implement realistic weather models that affect soil moisture, crop stress, and yield outcomes.

#### Environmental Interactions:

Incorporate interactions between crops and the environment, such as nutrient uptake, pest infestation, and disease spread.
Model soil health, including nutrient levels, pH balance, and organic matter content, with feedback loops to plant health.

#### Data Analytics and Visualization:

Collect and analyze simulation data, providing insights into crop performance, yield predictions, and the impact of different farming practices.
Visualize simulation results through graphs, charts, and maps for easy interpretation.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Rust (latest stable version)
Cargo (Rust's package manager)
Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pastorenue/agro_mini.git
cd agro_mini
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Usage
To run a basic simulation:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

You can configure the simulation parameters in the config.toml file to tailor the simulation to your needs.
